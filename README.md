# Bash

## About

I am learning bash scripting and in here i want to graduatly add usefull scripts for myself and anybody else.

## Installation

The install.sh script installs a full desktop environment with i3. It sets firefox with a theme, 
polybar, picom, i3lock-color, 
wallpapers with feh, oh-my-zsh with helpful commands. It first only works with a monitor because the 
internal display is disabled. 
With Vencord you can customize Discord with a bunch of plugins.

### How to install

Just run the install.sh script in your terminal after cloning this Repo.
Or just paste this in your terminal:
```shell 
git clone https://github.com/HanmaDevin/Linux.git
cd Linux 
./install.sh
```


### GRUB Themes

The grub-theme can be installed with python: ```sudo python3 <name of the theme.py> -i```
and to uninstall it do: ```sudo python3 <name of the theme.py> -u```

## NeoVim

The ***neovim.sh*** script-file helps you to quickly setup an IDE-like Text-editor in your terminal. We will use the LazyVim starter Repo to accomplish this.
To apply plugins run ```:Mason``` in neovim and install everything you need.
