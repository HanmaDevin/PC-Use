# Bash Scripts

## About

I am learning bash scripting and in here i want to graduatly add usefull scripts for myself and anybody else.

## Scripts

The after linux installation script walks you through a few steps to get your system with basic developer tools going.
First you can install what ever packages you want to install. Then you can setup git and create a beautiful terminal.
There is also a useful nano configuration which can be added. At the end you can install Vencord, a cool tool for Discord.
With Vencord you can customize Discord with a bunch of plugins.
